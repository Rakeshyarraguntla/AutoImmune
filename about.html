            They say every problem comes with a solution and the vision behind
            Immuny5 is to serve as a solution to those suffering from the
            perplexing problem of Autoimmune. The Founders of Immuny5 are a
            brother, who has lived with a serious case of autoimmune for the
            past 17 years and, a sister, who is a dental surgeon practicing
            clinical studies and has witnessed the taxing nature of autoimmune
            that affected every aspect of her brother's life.
            <br />
            <br />
            A disease with no cure or a clear treatment and its intensity only
            increasing with the march of time, autoimmune has attacked his skin,
            gut system, brain health, lungs and liver. Living with multiple
            autoimmune disorders, with a new diagnosis every year required the
            acceptance of a lifetime on multiple drugs, their side effects and
            pain management. This journey was made easier with the help and
            support of wonderful doctors, an ever-caring family and a deeper
            understanding of the human anatomy and healthcare management with
            the help of various educational courses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Realizing how knowledge gave an increased sense of control, mental
            strength and the willpower needed to battle autoimmune everyday, the
            brother-sister duo decided to embark on a mission to create a
            knowledge-based platform for those suffering with autoimmune. Born
            from this passion, Immuny5 strives to be the support system to those
            suffering from autoimmune conditions and make accessible to them a
            community of doctors and coaches who rely on a scientific and
            personalized approach to healthcare.​
